		<h1> On Career, Identity, Work</h1>
		<p>
		Ricky Scott is a pitmaster in a place called Hell’s Half Acre, South Carolina. He’s also the Director of Public Works for a nearby county, and in his spare time, he serves as a volunteer firefighter. I learned about Scott from a short documentary called Thursday in Hell’s Half Acre, made by 1504 Pictures for the Southern Foodways Alliance.1 “I have a day job, but after four o’clock on Thursdays I take off and go over on down to the barbecue business,” he says in the interview. Once a week, he smokes a pig and serves it to his neighbors. He’s open for three hours only, and he sells out every time.
	</p>
	<p>
There are a lot of people like Ricky Scott out there, splitting their time between things they need to do and things they want to do. He could quit his day job and try to live the pitmaster dream, but the Thursday-only barbecue business is working out just fine.
</p>
<p>
At some point in your life, someone has probably told you to “follow your dreams.” Maybe you’ve said it to someone else. It’s the quintessential inspirational advice. We tell our kids to follow their dreams from a young age. We say it in songs and commencement speeches, hand letter it for posters and journal covers. Most of the time it’s empty advice, designed to trigger emotion but not action.
</p>
<p>
These days, “follow your dreams” has sister phrases like “do what you love” and “quit your day job.” If you listen for these mantras, they’ll lead you to an entire genre of storytelling in creative industries, particularly in web design. The stories come in different forms: essays, marketing campaigns, conference talks, interviews. They’re usually formulaic, involving someone turning a personal experience into motivational advice for a wide audience. They are treated as gospel.
</p>
<p>
These stories can be deeply inspiring. Now, more than ever, people can direct their own paths and make a living from creative work. For many, the barrier to starting a business and selling your work is low. You can make a website in an hour with Squarespace. Raise thousands of dollars in a month with Kickstarter. Begin selling your products tomorrow with Etsy. Share your work instantly on Twitter, and measure it all with Google Analytics. There’s so much possibility for entrepreneurs and freelancers. If you have the right combination of resources, flexibility, and skills, you can start following your dreams right away.
</p>
<p>
For someone who knows they want a career change, is in the position to make one, and just needs to take a few steps to get there, motivational advice works. Personal testimony can be transformative. Finding a tribe of like-minded people who put a lot on the line to pursue their passions may be just the push someone needs to move forward.
</p>
<p>
But where does that leave the people who don’t have a calling or enough resources? To drop everything and do what you love, you need a safety net, flexibility, and a passion that also happens to be a marketable skill. It’s a beautiful thing when someone turns the fire in their belly into a fulfilling career, but the stories we tell about creativity don’t apply to everyone.
</p><P>
It’s time we examine the messages we’re sending about creative fulfillment and explore new ways to talk about our work.
</P>
<p>
Opening Up the Narrative </p>
<p>
Work is one part of life. It plays different roles for everyone. There’s not a single, teachable path to professional fulfillment. Translating “this worked for me” into “you should do what I did” is an anecdotal fallacy that can be as damaging over time as it is inspiring in the moment. When delivered without empathy, this kind of advice isolates people and devalues the kind of work most of us do every day.
</p>
<p>
Our world is much bigger than our industry. The concept of work, and expectations for professional autonomy and creative freedom, completely change when you shift your gaze outside the design community. Even within the mostly insulated design world, there’s nuance. There are varying levels of privilege. When we speak to people in our industry, we must consider the effect our words have on those who have chosen, or have had no choice but to take, different paths. And creating a more inclusive, more diverse, deeper-rooted design community requires—at the very least—speaking to people outside of it.
</p>
<p>And so, in a corner of the language I dedicated so much of my life to understanding and explaining, there is a memorial to my little girl: the named color “rebeccapurple.”</p>

<p>This was quite possibly the last thing I expected. When the proposal arose, I could barely make myself think, let alone objectively evaluate the merits of the proposal, which is why I stated that I was deeply honored by the proposal and would accept whatever decision the Working Group came to, pro or con.7 (I meant it, too. If the WG had declined to add “rebeccapurple” to CSS, I would have blogged in support of their decision.) I couldn’t really think about it in any coherent way, then or in the immediate aftermath. Besides adding the color to Rebecca’s memorial page on my website, I didn’t really think about it for a few months.</p>

<p>What pushed me to think about it was Gamergate.</p>

<p>Whatever you might think of Gamergate—and there’s a lot to think about it—I believe I can say at least this much without stepping on any land mines: it was when actor Adam Baldwin coined the hashtag #gamergate, and greatly boosted the signal on two videos made by people critical of Zoe Quinn, that the whole thing blew up into what we now think of as Gamergate, no hashtag.</p>

<p>In the process, there were threats—vicious, horrible threats—against not just Zoe Quinn, but also Brianna Wu and Anita Sarkeesian. All three women had experienced such threats in the past, but not with the same frequency or intensity that was seen during Gamergate.</p>

<p>I wasn’t even that deep into the situation—this was August and September 2014, when I was still pretty grief-stricken, and at any rate I’m no more than an occasional gamer—and I was sickened and horrified by so many of the things I saw. I cannot for an instant imagine what it must have been like to be at the focus of it all, or even near to the focus.</p>

<p>As my brain often does when confronted with horror, I retreated to analysis, hoping to draw something useful and constructive out of what seemed like a pointlessly destructive situation. It was an instinct that had helped me through everything that happened with Rebecca, and it helped me cope with the nauseating details I saw before me.</p>

<p>From that analytic distance, I realized I was seeing something structurally similar to the #663399becca campaign, but with such a different outcome.</p>

<p>In both cases, a situation that had already existed reached a sort of tipping point with the coining of a hashtag and a signal boost from a prominent personality. In response, groups of people organized to act.</p>

<p>With #663399becca, a collective tribute gave way to a formal, digital memorial. With #gamergate, a collective outrage gave way to terrible, real-world consequences.
</p>
<p>
We can look at these examples and say that the difference in outcome is the difference in input—that starting with positive intent leads to positive outcomes, and negative intent leads to negative outcomes. That’s certainly true. But it’s not the whole truth.
</p>
<p>
Some say that the medium in which these things happened is like a road, neutral to its uses—but roads are not neutral spaces, and neither is the internet.
</p>
<p>
While a ribbon of asphalt is neutral to its uses, we are not neutral to the uses of that asphalt. We decide where the road should go, which includes deciding who will have access to that road and who will not. We determine speed limits, caution areas, rules of the road. We don’t let people drive on whatever side of the road they feel like, or endanger pedestrians and other drivers. We establish laws and enforcement mechanisms. We even require licensing of the people who drive, to try to make sure that they understand at least a bare minimum of the rules before we allow them to use the road.
</p>
<p>
This is not an argument that we should license internet use. It’s pointing out that roads are not nearly as neutral as we all too often pretend. We set much lower speed limits around schools; we paint lines to indicate where passing is permitted and where it is not; we hire police officers and judges to penalize those who disregard the rules. Nothing about a road is neutral except for the raw material itself.
</p>
<p>
For that matter, almost nothing we do online these days is neutral. In the early days of the web, we were excited just to be able to look up some information and follow links from page to page—web surfing was a real thing back then, in the pre-search-engine era. Then we were thrilled to have great maps and the ability to have goods shipped to our houses. And back then, we were still trying to figure out what to share, and how and when to share it.
</p>
<P>
Now we share ourselves freely, continuously, one tidbit at a time but at a rapid pace. Social networks have emerged, and we share our thoughts and feelings with the world almost effortlessly, all the old hurdles of hosting and software installation outsourced to companies dedicated to making it simple. The web lets us do this without regard to time and distance, allows us to connect with people we otherwise would never have known existed. This should come as no surprise: humans have always longed to communicate, and most of all to be heard.
</P>
<p>
That’s how blogging came about. People starting putting their thoughts online, writing their own personal serial magazines, sharing themselves with whoever would listen. Some lost their jobs over what they shared, while others landed jobs. In every case, the motivation was the same: to be heard.
</p>
<p>
Now, anyone can follow that motivation, and millions upon millions do. Tweets, Facebook statuses, Tumblr posts, Instagram shares, Medium articles; these all exist to let us easily share what we think and feel and see with the world.
</p>
<p>
That’s one of the biggest differences between the early web and what we have now: that it’s easy to share ourselves. Entire business sectors have been built and vast fortunes made on making that impulse easier to satisfy.
</p>
<p>
The challenge now is in how those fragments of our lives are treated. This is as much a social question as a technological problem, but the two are not separable. What Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and every other at-scale social network does now—everything they make possible or impossible, everything they make easier or harder—will shape what we think of as normal in a decade or two. It won’t utterly control the way we use the web, but it will undoubtedly influence our online behavior at a deep level.
</p>
<p>
As an example, in 2030, will we think it’s acceptable to mute or block people who try to communicate with us? That seems like a ridiculous question to ask—of course it’s acceptable!—and yet, if networks make it harder to do so, or even if they make it easier to not do so, then the answer to that question could well change. Our grandchildren may think of the act of blocking as quaint and archaic, or even outright wrong.
</p>
<p>
Or, they might well think of our current situation as unthinkably permissive and damaging. If social networks make it easier to block harmful feedback and make attacks more difficult in the first place, then the answer to the question may change to the point that nobody thinks to ask the question anymore. The ability to mute and block and filter could become second nature.
</p>
<p>
If that seems too overblown, think about the differences between what constituted acceptable behavior when you were a child and what’s acceptable now. Not in the sense that “these kids today are disrespectful little punks, unlike like when I was a kid” (the inaccurate complaint of every generation), but in a social sense. Right now, kids think nothing of getting together physically to interact digitally. Looking at a mobile device while in conversation is something adults frown upon but kids don’t think of as abnormal, if they think of it at all. This didn’t happen because kids are less attentive to their friends. They just grew up in a world where that was possible, and they found it desirable. As they grow up more, everything they find on social networks, both content and capability, will seem just as normal. What they think of as risky or strange or acceptable or desirable will be profoundly shaped by their experiences.
</p>
<p>
People evolve and passion can be transient. When you ask children what they want to be when they grow up, they say things like astronaut, teacher, movie star, or president. But when they actually grow up, figure out who they are, and hone their skills, other options become available to them. Your dream one day isn’t the same as your dream ten years later, when you know more and have access to more. Following your dreams around can get complicated.
</p>
<p>
Even if your current job is not your final destination, it can mean something to you. Even if you’re not in a field related to your personal interests, you can be happy and fulfilled at work. And if you’re working to pay the bills so you can take care of your family, that doesn’t mean you’re denying your dreams. It might mean exactly the opposite.
</p>
<p>
“Follow your dreams” sounds nice, but it’s almost always more fulfilling to follow your needs.
</p>
<P>
I can’t stop thinking about Ricky Scott in Hell’s Half Acre. Rewatching the documentary, my respect for him grew deeper. Every day he goes to work at the county office and does what he needs to do. As a firefighter, he volunteers his time doing hard work that matters to him and his community. And on Thursdays, when he’s doling out pulled pork on Styrofoam plates, he’s simply doing what he loves. He’s arranged his life in a way that suits him. It’s malleable, can change at any time, and it’s not for anyone else to replicate. He has financial and emotional needs, and his abundant life fulfills them. Ricky Scott’s work does not define him.
</P>
<p>
“Some day I may go full-time with barbecue,” he says in the film. “But so far, rather than doing that I’d rather keep it like it is right now. I put one hundred and one percent in it, and make sure it goes on as long as I can do it.”
