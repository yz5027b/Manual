		<p> Mentoring relationships are complex and tenuous, but they work best when the needs they fulfill are clearly identified. And like any relationship, they require nothing less than mutual vulnerability.

		<h1> On Career, People, Relationships</h1>

		<p>My wife Kat and I spent almost every moment of Saturday, June 7, 2014, An idea came to me on the train to work. I went to Amazon.com on my phone, tapped in the name of the book I’d just finished reading,1 and sent a second copy to my former professor. Then, I wrote him an email asking him to pass the book along to a student—“perhaps a bit shy, but mischievous”—who could use it. “My email address is enclosed on an attached note,” I continued, “and I’d love to hear from the student once she’s read it.”</p>
		<p>

The book landed with a young woman named Jane Chun. I heard back from her a few months later, just before Thanksgiving. When she came home to California to visit her family, we met in person for the first time. We had so much to talk about.
</p>
<p>
After Thanksgiving, Jane and I kept up our correspondence. Every so often, one of us would revive an old email thread or send a note to say, “thinking of you.”
</p>
<p>
Our exchanges intensified in the summer of 2011 when Jane wrote to ask for advice on an upcoming interview, initiating a back-and-forth that spanned several weeks. After the interview was over and the only thing left was to wait, she sent a note of thanks: “Throughout this process you have been such an incredible mentor to me, and I really appreciate all the time you have put into answering my questions.”2
</p>
<P>
My heart surged: I’d never been called a mentor before. Jane’s matter-of-fact tone made her words easier to accept. There was no coronation ceremony—no praise to resist. Just an observation, an offhanded remark. Its straightforwardness gave it the ring of truth.
</P>
<p>
When Jane called me her mentor, it changed the way I saw myself. I was spellbound by the sense of wholeness that came from being useful just by being myself. I wanted to feel that way all the time. I wanted everyone to feel that way all the time. The invocation of the word “mentor” was the turning point for me. I thought that sharing that soaring feeling could be as simple as invoking the word “mentor” more often.
</p>
<p>
So, I started a project called /mentoring. “Anyone can be a part of /mentoring,” I wrote by way of introduction on August 30, 2011. “All it takes is a few lines of text on your own website, blog, or other profile, expressing your openness to mentoring and offering a specific invitation to get in touch.”
</p>
<p>
Tense but hopeful, itching for escape velocity, I decided to go big: “I’m calling it ‘/mentoring’ because I hope that eventually it will be as natural a part of the internet as ‘/about’ pages. I’m placing my invitation at http://dianakimball.com/mentoring, and I invite you to do the same.”
</p>
<p>
The response was immediate and affirmative. Friends and strangers tweeted and retweeted about /mentoring; a few even put up pages based on the template I’d shared. I could feel momentum building. But almost as soon as /mentoring took off, I started to have misgivings.
</p>
<p>
As reports from the field rolled in, I began to feel like I’d sent my friends up a creek without a paddle. There were the basic questions I’d only lightly anticipated: when a stranger writes to ask for advice, how and when do you transition that conversation to the phone? Once you’re on the phone, how do you take responsibility for overcoming the awkwardness and opening up the conversation in earnest? As the conversation winds down, how do you broach the topic of whether the person on the other end can expect an ongoing relationship or needs to make peace with it being a one-time thing?
</p>
<p>
And then there were more difficult questions that emerged only in practice. If it turns out that the person is, quite transparently, trying to bolster their chances at a job interview with you—as actually happened to one friend of mine—how do you bounce back from the feeling of manipulation? What if their listlessness or lack of direction seems every bit like depression, but you don’t have enough context to say for sure, and it’s not your place to say, anyway? What if what they want from you isn’t actually something you have to give?
</p>
<p>
Alarmed by the legions of awkward interactions I felt sure I’d unleashed through /mentoring, I retreated from the project after a few short months. Although the instructions for setting up /mentoring pages remained online, and many friends’ open invitations persisted on their websites—whether through willing dedication, obligation, or inertia, I still don’t know—I promoted the project less and less, and eventually, stopped entirely. What started as a movement became a liability.
</p>
<P>
The awkwardness of mentoring had mesmerized me, though, and I wasn’t ready to let go. The whole experience of introducing /mentoring and then witnessing its gentle fallout had only reinforced my belief that the word had power. I needed to understand it. So in the spring of 2012, my friend Beau Rowland and I embarked on a research project: we were going to solve the mystery of mentoring.
</P>
<p>I wasn’t even that deep into the situation—this was August and September 2014, when I was still pretty grief-stricken, and at any rate I’m no more than an occasional gamer—and I was sickened and horrified by so many of the things I saw. I cannot for an instant imagine what it must have been like to be at the focus of it all, or even near to the focus.</p>

<p>As my brain often does when confronted with horror, I retreated to analysis, hoping to draw something useful and constructive out of what seemed like a pointlessly destructive situation. It was an instinct that had helped me through everything that happened with Rebecca, and it helped me cope with the nauseating details I saw before me.</p>

<p>From that analytic distance, I realized I was seeing something structurally similar to the #663399becca campaign, but with such a different outcome.</p>

<p>In both cases, a situation that had already existed reached a sort of tipping point with the coining of a hashtag and a signal boost from a prominent personality. In response, groups of people organized to act.</p>

<p>With #663399becca, a collective tribute gave way to a formal, digital memorial. With #gamergate, a collective outrage gave way to terrible, real-world consequences.
</p>
<p>
We can look at these examples and say that the difference in outcome is the difference in input—that starting with positive intent leads to positive outcomes, and negative intent leads to negative outcomes. That’s certainly true. But it’s not the whole truth.
</p>
<p>
Some say that the medium in which these things happened is like a road, neutral to its uses—but roads are not neutral spaces, and neither is the internet.
</p>
<p>
While a ribbon of asphalt is neutral to its uses, we are not neutral to the uses of that asphalt. We decide where the road should go, which includes deciding who will have access to that road and who will not. We determine speed limits, caution areas, rules of the road. We don’t let people drive on whatever side of the road they feel like, or endanger pedestrians and other drivers. We establish laws and enforcement mechanisms. We even require licensing of the people who drive, to try to make sure that they understand at least a bare minimum of the rules before we allow them to use the road.
</p>
<p>
This is not an argument that we should license internet use. It’s pointing out that roads are not nearly as neutral as we all too often pretend. We set much lower speed limits around schools; we paint lines to indicate where passing is permitted and where it is not; we hire police officers and judges to penalize those who disregard the rules. Nothing about a road is neutral except for the raw material itself.
</p>
<p>
For that matter, almost nothing we do online these days is neutral. In the early days of the web, we were excited just to be able to look up some information and follow links from page to page—web surfing was a real thing back then, in the pre-search-engine era. Then we were thrilled to have great maps and the ability to have goods shipped to our houses. And back then, we were still trying to figure out what to share, and how and when to share it.
</p>
<P>
Now we share ourselves freely, continuously, one tidbit at a time but at a rapid pace. Social networks have emerged, and we share our thoughts and feelings with the world almost effortlessly, all the old hurdles of hosting and software installation outsourced to companies dedicated to making it simple. The web lets us do this without regard to time and distance, allows us to connect with people we otherwise would never have known existed. This should come as no surprise: humans have always longed to communicate, and most of all to be heard.
</P>
<p>
That’s how blogging came about. People starting putting their thoughts online, writing their own personal serial magazines, sharing themselves with whoever would listen. Some lost their jobs over what they shared, while others landed jobs. In every case, the motivation was the same: to be heard.
</p>
<p>
Now, anyone can follow that motivation, and millions upon millions do. Tweets, Facebook statuses, Tumblr posts, Instagram shares, Medium articles; these all exist to let us easily share what we think and feel and see with the world.
</p>
<p>
That’s one of the biggest differences between the early web and what we have now: that it’s easy to share ourselves. Entire business sectors have been built and vast fortunes made on making that impulse easier to satisfy.
</p>
<p>
The challenge now is in how those fragments of our lives are treated. This is as much a social question as a technological problem, but the two are not separable. What Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and every other at-scale social network does now—everything they make possible or impossible, everything they make easier or harder—will shape what we think of as normal in a decade or two. It won’t utterly control the way we use the web, but it will undoubtedly influence our online behavior at a deep level.
</p>
<p>
As an example, in 2030, will we think it’s acceptable to mute or block people who try to communicate with us? That seems like a ridiculous question to ask—of course it’s acceptable!—and yet, if networks make it harder to do so, or even if they make it easier to not do so, then the answer to that question could well change. Our grandchildren may think of the act of blocking as quaint and archaic, or even outright wrong.
</p>
<p>
Or, they might well think of our current situation as unthinkably permissive and damaging. If social networks make it easier to block harmful feedback and make attacks more difficult in the first place, then the answer to the question may change to the point that nobody thinks to ask the question anymore. The ability to mute and block and filter could become second nature.
</p>
<p>
If that seems too overblown, think about the differences between what constituted acceptable behavior when you were a child and what’s acceptable now. Not in the sense that “these kids today are disrespectful little punks, unlike like when I was a kid” (the inaccurate complaint of every generation), but in a social sense. Right now, kids think nothing of getting together physically to interact digitally. Looking at a mobile device while in conversation is something adults frown upon but kids don’t think of as abnormal, if they think of it at all. This didn’t happen because kids are less attentive to their friends. They just grew up in a world where that was possible, and they found it desirable. As they grow up more, everything they find on social networks, both content and capability, will seem just as normal. What they think of as risky or strange or acceptable or desirable will be profoundly shaped by their experiences.
</p>
<p>
Kathy Sierra, who has been targeted for harassment more than once, relates in her book Badass that the horse trainer’s mantra is: “Make the right thing easy and the wrong thing difficult.”8 Now consider the converse: what is easy comes to be accepted as the right thing, and what is difficult comes to be regarded as the wrong thing. That’s why I say what we do now isn’t neutral. Everything we do, from what we share to how we interact with our networks to how those networks are structured, is influencing the near future of our societies. Not just the hyper-digital developed world’s societies, but all societies everywhere, because what happens online will shape what happens offline.
</p>
<p>
And speaking of concepts that may make no sense in a couple of decades, consider the idea that there’s a distinction between online and offline. We often try to demarcate them, talking about the virtual and real worlds as if the internet is a different planet that we sometimes visit and then return home. That’s never been true, but the mobile revolution has made the fiction obvious. The internet is no more a separate, “virtual” world than are books or songs. We talk to each other directly, and share ourselves, whatever the medium.
</p>
<p>
We wouldn’t say that by making a phone call we enter a different world; when we go online, we aren’t going away either. Wherever we go, we take ourselves with us, and seek to be heard.
</p>
<p>
When we’re comfortable enough to shift between high and low at will, laughter and epiphanies erupt. Freed from the expectations of knowing everything or knowing nothing, we can get closer to the truth together. It’s why I asked my professor to introduce me to a student who was “perhaps a bit shy, but mischievous.” I wanted to meet someone who could hold her own. I wanted to help, but I didn’t want to be held to a rigid standard; I wanted to be myself.
</p>
<p>
To be acknowledged as a mentor in hindsight is meaningful because it is a form of thanks. To be asked upfront to be someone’s mentor is unnerving because it’s a boundless request, an inchoate please. The word has power both ways. But if we set aside the word and go back to basic needs, mentoring starts to look like something much simpler: friendship. Of all the possible outcomes of mentoring, the best one is ending up on the same level.
</p>

So it was that one day in June 2013, Jane showed up at the apartment my boyfriend and I shared in San Francisco. I was moving to Berlin and needed help like nobody’s business. She knew this, and decided to pitch in as part of saying goodbye. Jane surveyed the kitchen, clapped her hands, and began. Together, we bundled cups and bowls in bubble wrap and talked about our days.
