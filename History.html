				<h1>History
				</h1>
				<p>The Manual is the brainchild of our publisher, Andy McMillan, and it began as a Kickstarter project in early 2011. The project’s successful funding made it possible for us to publish our first issue exclusively in print, followed later by Issue 2 and Issue 3 in 2012.
</p><p>
Each issue continues to feature six unique, talented writers who contribute one substantial, thought-provoking article and one deeply personal lesson. Each article is illustrated by a contributing illustrator, with a separate bold art centerpiece in the middle of the book.
</p><p>
The Manual team took a hiatus to rebuild and resumed a regular publishing schedule in 2014, releasing Issue 4 in October.
		</p>
				<h2> The Manual,Everywhere </h2>
				<p>We unveiled new offerings in fall 2014 with the launch of a new a Kickstarter project, The Manual, Everywhere. The project announced a drastic rethink of The Manual’s purpose and role in the community, introducing brand-new ebook and audiobook editions, an open web edition available to all under a Creative Commons license, and a refreshed, unified identity.</p>
				<p>

We want to stimulate reflection, reaction, and reference in our practice and help more people contribute to the conversation around design for the web.
</p>
<p>
And we want to build a sustainable publishing model on top of what has brought our discipline to where it is today: generosity, and the free sharing of ideas.
</p>
<p>
You can read our web editions in full on this site and support us and our contributors by buying issues from our temporary store or backing our Kickstarter project.
